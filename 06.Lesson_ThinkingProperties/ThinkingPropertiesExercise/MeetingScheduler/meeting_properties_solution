# Meeting
## Rules
### Valid State
1. (state = UNINITIALIZED) => all fields in ScheduledMeeting shall be empty.

### State Transitions
2. (beforeState = PENDING and afterState = STARTED) => f.selector = startMeeting(uint256)

### Variable Transitions
3. ScheduledMeeting.organizer can only be set when transiting from UNINITIALIZED and possibly unset when transiting to END or CANCELLED.

### High-Level Properties
4. For a meeting, except for its termination (either cancelled by owner or ended), startTime and endTime must not be changed by non-owner.

### Unit Tests
5. After joinMeeting is called, numOfParticipants is increased by 1.

## Priority
### High
- Rule 2: if a meeting can be started by methods other than startMeeting, the meeting owner might fail to manage the life time of the meeting properly.
- Rule 3: If the organizer can be changed unexpectedly the meeting owner will not be able to manage the meeting properly.
- Rule 4: if startTime and endTime can be changed by a non-owner, the meeting might be ended up unexpectedly (possibly DoSed).

### Medium
- Rule 1: even though it's undesired and error-prone if a meeting has non-empty value at start, the field can be overridden after initialization.

### Low
- Rule 5: because it can be easily verified either by other means or manual check.
