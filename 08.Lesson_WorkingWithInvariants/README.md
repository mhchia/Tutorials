# Working With Invariants

- [x] Follow the instructions in [Invariants Concepts](InvariantsConcepts) to learn about preserved blocks and the correct structure of verifications in spec files.

- [ ] Go back to your list of properties for [Spartan Protocol](WritingRules/SpartanProtocol) and [Popsicle Finance](WritingRules/PopsicleFinance). Choose at least 5-7 properties from each system that you think you can write using the CVL commands you've learned so far. Try to verify them.

- [ ] Create a new `.spec` file for each system in the corresponding directory within [Writing Rules](WritingRules) and write rules that express your properties. Try writing rules implementing as many categories you can (valid states, state transitions, unit test, etc.)

> :warning: Note that both systems have known bugs in them. You can read more about the bugs and attack vectors in the README files of each system's directory.

Upload your solutions to the respective directories for a review by the Certora team.

## Vacuous Rules

- [ ] Continue to next lesson: [High Level Properties](../09.Lesson_HighLevelProperties) to practice some more thinking about properties, notice which property is appropriate for defining as invariant
