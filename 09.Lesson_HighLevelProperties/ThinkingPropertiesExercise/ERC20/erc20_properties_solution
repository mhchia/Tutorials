# ERC20
## Rules
### Valid State

### State Transitions

### Variable Transitions
- 1. allowance increased -> approve, increaseAllowance
- 2. allowance decreased -> approve, decreaseAllowance, transferFrom

### High-Level Properties
- 3. totalSupply >= user balance
- 4. transfer, transferFrom: balanceToBefore + balanceFromBefore == balanceToAfter + balanceFromAfter

### Unit Tests
- 5. transfer
- 6. approve

## Priority
### High
- 3 is high because it guarantees total supply is correct.
- 4 is correct because it guarantees balances is not messed up after transfer.

### Medium
- 1, 2 are medium because they are straight forward and less possible to have bugs.

### Low
- 5, 6 are low because they can be done by other approaches.
